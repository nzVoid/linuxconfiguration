## Embedded scripts
i3edit.sh - launching the i3 config in nano
monitor_setup.sh - checks whether an external monitor is connected, if connected, it turns off the laptop screen.

## Keyboard shortcuts
**mod+Shift+Insert** - activates switching the layout from Russian to English. It turns on at the start of the session, but it does not fly off, so a shortcut is made
**mod+Shift+Insert** - executing the monitor_setup.sh
